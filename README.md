**Role**
I was analysing data in the organization.

**Project goal**
- Conducted a thorough data cleaning process to ensure that the data used for analysis was accurate and reliable.
- Developed a linear chart that visualized the number of Volume and total revenue generated by doctors on a monthly basis, allowing stakeholders to track performance over time.
- Compared the actual performance to the target (Expected Achievement) for each month, providing insight into how well doctors were meeting their performance goals.
- Calculated the average Charge per Volume, which provided a more detailed view of doctors' performance by accounting for differences in volume between doctors.

**Solution**
- Discovered an issue with the target setting methodology in the last quarter, which could have led to inaccurate assessments of doctors' performance.
- Revised the target setting methodology to ensure that targets were more realistic and achievable, improving the accuracy of performance assessments.
- Worked collaboratively with stakeholders to communicate the changes to the target setting methodology and ensure that everyone was on board with the new approach.
- Presented the revised performance metrics to senior leadership, providing them with a more accurate view of doctors' performance and helping them make more informed decisions.
- Contributed to the overall success of the organization by providing actionable insights that led to improvements in performance and revenue generation.
